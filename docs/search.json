Bayesian prediction and decision making under uncertainty is carefully explained, and you will hopefully see why Bayesian methods are so useful in modern application where so much focuses on prediction and decision making.\nThe really interesting stuff starts to happen when we study regression and classification. You will learn how prior distributions can be seen as regularization that allows us to use flexible models with many parameters without overfitting the data and improving predictive performance.\nA new world will open up when we learn how complex models can be analyzed with simulation methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and approximate optimization methods like Variational Inference (VI).\nYou will also get a taste for probabilistic programming languages for Bayesian learning, in particular the popular Stan language in R.\nFinally, we’ll round off with an introduction to Bayesian model selection and Bayesian variable selection.\n\n\n\nLiterature\n\nVillani, M. (2025a). Bayesian Learning. This is the main book for the course.\nGelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, Rubin (2014). Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA). Chapman & Hall/CRC: Boca Raton, Florida. 3rd edition. Here is the book webpage and a free PDF version.\nAdditional material and handouts distributed during the course.\n\nIf you need to refresh some basic mathematics, like derivatives and integrals, you may find the first chapter of this Prequel book useful:\n\nVillani, M. (2025b). Bayesian Learning - the prequel. Notes on basic mathematics, probability and statistical inference. Work in progress, expect typos.\n\n\n\nStructure\nThe course consists of lectures, mathematical exercises and computer labs.\n\n\nExamination\nThe course is examined by a\n\nwritten exam (grades A-F)\nhome assignment (grade pass/fail).\n\n\n\nSchedule\nThe course schedule can be found on TimeEdit. A tip is to select Subscribe in the upper right corner of TimeEdit and then paste the link into your phone’s calendar program.\n\n\nInteractive material\nThe course makes use of interactive Observable notebooks in javascript that runs in your browser. The widgets will be linked below each relevant lecture. All widgets used in the course are available here.\n\n\nTeachers\n\n\n\n\nMattias VillaniCourse responsible and LecturerProfessor \n\n\n\nOskar GustafssonExercises and Computer labs  PhD in Statistics and Senior Lecturer\n\n\n\n\n\nAkram MahmoudiExercises and Computer labs  PhD in Statistics and Lecturer\n\n\n\nValentin ZuljExercises and Computer labs  PhD student in Statistics and Teaching assistant"
